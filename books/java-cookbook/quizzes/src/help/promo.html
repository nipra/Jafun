   <TITLE>TestEdit, the Exam Processor from Darwin Open Systems</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BACKGROUND=texture42.gif>
TestEdit is a very special-purpose editing tool, an
Exam Processor for editing and formatting 
multiple-choice examinations. A general word processor
like WordPerfect or Microsoft Word can do many things, but a word processor
doesn't understand the structure of your data.
<H2>No Structure?</H2>
The notion of structure in data is why we have invented spreadsheets. And
SGML. And XML. And databases. (And lack of structure is one reason that we 
have "the Year 2000 crisis" in software).
It's a recognition that a general purpose word
processor cannot distinguish between the answer to a question and the text
of the question, and so it cannot handle the special requirements of formatting,
printing, and storing the information.
<H2> The Solution</H2>
TestEdit was originally written out of the frustration that a Learning Tree
instructor and author who is also a computer
programming professional felt when dealing with multiple-choice exams
stored in a word processor.
No structure, and no standard processing. 
Two courses that shared some questions meant each change had to be processed twice (per exam, and there are three exams per course).
Students occasionally received the version of the exam with the answers marked, because they look too much like the student version.
<P><IMG SRC="mainwind.gif" HEIGHT=379 WIDTH=601 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>As you can see, the main window provides many of the common
operations. You can jump to any question either by
typing its number or by dragging a slider, or process questions
one at a time using the Next/Previous buttons.
<H2>The Menus</H2>
<P>But wait, there's more! The File menu lets you XXX
<P>The Edit menu lets you XXX
<P>And the View menu lets you see the Statistics...
<H3>Statistics</H3>
<IMG SRC="statwind.gif">
<P>We particularly like the Statistics report, which shows 
not only how many A, B, C and D answers there are, but also
how many incomplete questions, questions with no answer, and
questions with no Chapter Objective. This can be helpful
in assessing new exams from authors, as well as for monitoring
ongoing changes.
<H2>This is a work in progress</H2>
<P>The version being shown here is a prototype, and lacks some
important features. That does not mean it is a toy - it is a 
full-scale program developed using object-oriented programming
models and techniques.
<P>The limitations? First, the questions and answers have as yet no
format capability, to allow keywords in bold, computer input in Courier,
or whatever. Many of the editing capabilities (such as Find, and
Cut/Copy/Paste) do not function yet in this version.
But you can see - from the shaded menu items - 
the functionality that is planned.
<P>As well, during the later stages of development, we can work
with the publications team to add or change functionality.
<H2>Many Output Formats</H2>
<P>TestEdit can directly print a draft of the exam. This will not
get mixed up with what we send the students, because it is clearly
marked as being a draft. It shows the exam and the correct answers,
and is an ideal format for proofing by authors, TEs, and others.
<P>TestEdit can save in its own format (see below). But it can also export
a file to the web, so that you can run the questions interactively
for Intranet/Internet delivery.
The present version, already
being used in some courses to provide 
<A HREF="471review.html">review questions that the
students can answer after each chapter</A>,
generates simple but adequate HTML.
A later version will be component-based for better delivery
with no cheating.
The program can [soon] also generate Microsoft Rich Text Format documents that 
MS Word can open directly.
And, it is planned to add the ability to generate a Sylvan
Prometric file, so that exams can be sent directly to Sylvan
without any further manual processing (this capability depends
on obtaining the proprietary file format that they use).
Because TestEdit is object-oriented, it is fairly easy to 
<A HREF="addformat.html">add new file formats</A>.
<H2>TestEdit Runs on Any Platform!</H2>
<P>Now you no longer need to worry about authors who work on different
computing platforms than your central publications department.
<I>TestEdit is totally portable to any modern computing platform</I>.
While the standard version is a native MS-Windows 95/98/NT binary,
the included Java binary can be run on MS-Windows, Macintosh, Solaris,
Linux, OpenBSD, Novell, or any other Java-enabled computing platform.
The software installs easily using standard installation tools
(InstallShield on MS-Windows and InstallAnywhere on Java).
<H3>The TestEdit File Format</H3>
<P>The program's native file format is not RTF,
nor a proprietary binary file like an MS-Word document, but a`
<A HREF="fileformat.html"> structured text file</A> format. 
Authors who prefer to work in existing tools
can prepare input using vi, emacs, perl, WordPerfect (save as Text), or any
other edtior of their choice, and need only validate using TestEdit
before sending the files to your publications department.
